    <div class="desc">The Indian Ocean Trade Network worked only because of the monsoon winds for the following reasons:
      they made trade faster, they made trade predictable, and they made trade more flexible.</div>
    <br><br />
    <img class="img3" src="../monsoon-pattern.jpg" alt="monsoon-pattern">
    <div class="desc">One of the reasons that the monsoon winds helped the Indian Ocean Trade was that it largely
      boosted the speed of trade. This might seem like traders would sit in their ships, waiting for a spottaneous wind
      to pass by. Well... not really. The monsoon winds were actually extremely predictable. Merchants would plan trips
      according to their destination, and when they wanted to go. Ocean currents paired up with monsoon winds created a
      dynamic duo. And from April to October, the mosoons were very heavy, and they would blow northeast to India from
      Africa. But the problem was that from November to March, the monsoons would blow in the opposite direction, making
      it hard for African merchants to travel to India. However, during that time, Indian merchants could actually have
      their turn in trading with Africans. Meaning that the Indians would go towards Africa during that time instead of
      the Africans trading towards India. Even though the winds were harsh and very fast, the round trip for going and
      coming back for anyone would take almost a year! </div>
    <br><br/>
    <div class="desc">Another reason the monsoon winds supported the Indian Ocean trade was because the Monsoons were so
      predictable that the sailors would actually learn to predict the winds, and that would have caused more people to
      start trading there. And ultimately, that would have boosted the Network, and it would have gained popularity,
      causing it to get more people to use it, and getting more support. This also helped in the development of both
      religions, through Africa and India. </div>
    <div class = "desc">One other reason the Monsoon winds supported the Indian Ocean Trade Network was that most people would use the
    sea and boats to travel/trade. Traveling on boats and ships was very easy. Especially during the time of the Indian
    Ocean Trade, trading through boats was very popular. So many people would take the effort to learn how to sail, and
    they would have used to go through the Indian Ocean Trade network. And the monsoon winds made it easier for them.
    They would learn how to sail, but the monsoon winds would do most of the work. Meaning that it would take them
    farther and faster. The monsoon winds also provide good training for the people that were sailing. And that's
    another reason why people would use it more than other trade networks. </div>
