    <div class="desc">The Indian Ocean Trade route was one of the most impactful trade routes of the medieval times. The
      three main reasons for this claim are that the Indian Ocean Trade route made trading faster, connected many
      countries, and brought wealth to many different kingdoms and empires.</div>
    <div class="desc">The Indian Ocean Trade route was called the "Monsoons Marketplace" for a reason. If you didn't get
      the hint, it was because of the monsoon winds. This actually stimulated the popularity of the Indian Ocean Trade
      route. This is because the monsoon winds actually made trade faster. Traders would savor this so much because the
      monsoon winds were also extremely predictable. This made it particularly easy for the trader to plan trips
      according to their destination. For example, from October to November, cool, dry air is drawn from the Himalayas
      and blown southeast across the Arabian Sea towards Africa. This actually allowed merchants to make a round trip to
      India possibly within an year. In contrast, doing the same trip taking the Silk Road actually took more than an
      year, despite the distance advantage. Boat travel was most commonly used in the Indian Ocean Trade route. Trade
      benefited from this in general, but the ocean currents and the monsoon winds created a jolting duo in terms of
      speed. These factors led the Indian Ocean Trade route to have its well known speed.</div>
    <br><br />
    <img src="../indian-trade-map.jpg" alt="indian-trade-map">
    <div class="desc">Almost all trade routes connected countries, but not to the extent that the Indian Ocean Trade
      route took it to. The Indian Ocean Trade route connected the vast empires and kingdoms along Southeast Asia,
      India, Arabia, and East Africa. This had many benefits such as diverse religions and materials being traded. For
      example, China and Africa were able rise in the gold industry, giving many people access to gold through the
      Indian Ocean Trade route. Iron works also thrived, giving many different countries awareness to different
      materials and new crafting styles. These are just a few examples of the possible sight of encoutners (SOE).
      Religion also had an opportunity to spread. While other trade routes connected countries that possesed similar
      religions, the Indian Ocean Trade route connected countries with many different religions. For example, Buddhism
      and many other Chinese influences spread along the Indian Ocean Trade route. Spice trade was a result of the
      spread of culture. Overall, the Indian Ocean Trade route linked many different countries and made it possible to
      create new SOE's.</div>

    <img class="img2" src="../Almoravid-Coin.webp" alt="Almoravid-Coin">
    <div class="desc">The previous paragraph mentioned how iron and gold works could be traded through the Indian Ocean
      Trade route. Well believe it or not, the Indian Ocean Trade route actually made other countries wealthy. I know
      this sounds like one of those sketchy "How to become rich ads," but it's not. The Indian Ocean Trade route made
      the booming trade of gold possible by creating many connections to gold wielders such as Africa. West Africans
      extensively mined gold, which was eventually used to make Almoravid Gold Coins. This currency became popular in
      north-west Africa, as well as the Iberian Peninsula. The once humble Almoravid Gold Coin became popular in those
      areas, finally influencing more currencies to emerge. This influenced new types of money like paper money in
      China. Thus, trading with money started to increase, giving many countries the opportunity to become wealthy.
